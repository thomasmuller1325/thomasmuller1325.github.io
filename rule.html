        <h1>Blackjack rules</h1>
        <h2><a name='overview'>Overview of Blackjack</a></h2>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular and straightforward casino games. It is typically played at a table with one to seven players competing against a dealer. The objective is to achieve a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21 (busting). Despite its simplicity, it involves strategy and decision-making to maximize the odds of winning.</p>
        <h2><a name='objective'>Objective</a></h2>
<p>The player's goal is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:
Outscore the dealer by having a hand total closer to 21 without busting.
Dealer busts (exceeds 21), while the player's hand does not.
Drawing a blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) when the dealer does not.</a></p>
        <h2><a name='cv'>Card Values</a></h2>
<p>Number cards (2–10): Face value (e.g., a 7 is worth 7 points).
Face cards (King, Queen, Jack): Each is worth 10 points.
Ace: Flexible, worth either 1 or 11 points depending on what benefits the hand most without busting.</p>
        <h2><a name='gs'>Gameplay Structure</a></h2>
<p>1. Betting:
Players place their bets before the cards are dealt. Minimum and maximum bets vary by table.
2. The Deal:
Each player is dealt two cards face up.
The dealer receives two cards:
One face up (the "upcard").
One face down (the "hole card").
A blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) in the initial two cards is an automatic win unless the dealer also has a blackjack.</p>
       <h2><a name='pa'>Player Actions</a></h2>
<p>Players act in turn, starting from the left of the dealer (first base). They can choose from the following options:

Hit:

Request an additional card to increase the hand value.
You can hit multiple times unless your hand exceeds 21 (bust).
Stand:

Keep your current total and end your turn.
No further cards are drawn.
Double Down:

Double your initial bet, receive exactly one additional card, and end your turn.
Typically allowed on specific totals like 9, 10, or 11, depending on house rules.
Split:

If the first two cards are of the same rank (e.g., two 8s), you can split them into two separate hands.
Each hand requires an additional bet equal to the original.
Some rules allow re-splitting or restrict certain actions after splitting (e.g., hitting on split Aces).
Surrender (optional in some games):

Forfeit half of your bet to end your hand early.
Usually allowed only on the initial two cards.
Insurance:

Offered if the dealer's upcard is an Ace.
A side bet, typically half your original bet, that pays 2:1 if the dealer has a blackjack.
Statistically unfavorable, often discouraged.</p>
<h2><a name='ws'>Winning Scenarios</a></h2>
<p>Player Wins:

The player's hand value is higher than the dealer's without exceeding 21.
The dealer busts.
Blackjack:

A hand of an Ace and a 10-value card in the first two cards.
Pays out at 3:2, meaning a $10 bet wins $15.
Push:

The player and dealer have the same total (excluding blackjack).
The player’s bet is returned.
Player Loses:

The player's hand busts (exceeds 21).
The dealer's hand is closer to 21 without busting.</p>

<h2><a name='payouts'>Betting and Payouts</a></h2>
<p>Winning hand: Pays 1:1 (even money).<br>
Blackjack payout: Pays 3:2 (some tables offer 6:5, but it’s less favorable).<br>
Insurance: Pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack.</p>
<h2><a name='tips'>Tips</a></h2>
<p>Use basic strategy charts for decision-making, which are based on the mathematical probabilities of each hand.<br>
Avoid insurance bets unless counting cards, as they statistically favor the house.<br>
Be mindful of table limits and house rules before playing.</p>
